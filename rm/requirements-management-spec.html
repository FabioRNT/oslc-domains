<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This specification defines the OSLC Requirements Management domain, also known as OSLC RM. The specification supports key RESTful web service interfaces for software Requirements Management systems. OSLC takes an open, loosely coupled approach to specific lifecycle integration scenarios. The scenarios and this specification were created by the OASIS OSLC Lifecycle Integration for Domains TC.</p>
 
<p>This specification builds on the Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration Core Specification [[!OSLCCore3]] to define the resources, properties and operations supported by an OSLC Requirements Definition and Management (OSLC-RM) provider.</p>

<p>Requirements Management resources include Requirements, Requirements Collections and supporting resources defined in the OSLC Core specification. The properties defined describe these resources and the relationships between resources. Operations are defined in terms of HTTP methods and MIME type handling. The resources, properties and operations defined do not form a comprehensive interface to Requirements Definition and Management, but instead target specific integration use cases documented by the OSLC-RM workgroup.</p>

  <section id="conventions"></section>

  <section id='terminology' class='informative'>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
  <p>Terminology uses and extends the terminology and capabilities of [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>
      <dl class="glossary">
      <dt>Requirement Resource</dt>
      <dd>Requirements are the basis for defining what the system stakeholders (users, customers, suppliers and so on)           need from a system and also what the system must do in order to meet those needs, and how the surrounding           processes must be orchestrated so that quality, scope and timescale objectives are satisfied.</dd>

      <dt>RequirementCollection Resource</dt>
      <dd>A collection of resources which constitute some statement of need.</dd> 
        
    <dt>Client</dt>
    <dd>An implementation of the OSLC Requirement Management specifications as a client. OSLC RM Clients consume services provided by servers.</dd>

    <dt>Server</dt>
    <dd>An implementation of the OSLC Requirement Management specifications as a server. OSLC RM clients consume services provided by Servers. The use of the terms Client and Server are intended to distinguish typical consumers and providers of OSLC resources in a distributed environment based on REST. A particular application component could be a client for some OSLC domain services and a server for the same or another domain.</dd>

<h2>Base Requirements</h2>
  
<section id="compliance">
<h2>Compliance</h2>
<p>This specification is based on [[!OSLCCore3]]. OSLC RM clients and servers
MUST be compliant with both the core specification and this RM
specification, and SHOULD follow all the guidelines and recommendations in both of 
these specifications.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes the requirements from OSLC Core Specification
as well as some additional requirements specific to the RM domain. Note that
this specification further restricts some of the requirements for OSLC Core
Specification. See subsequent sections in this specification or the
OSLC Core Specification to get further details on each of these
requirements.</p>

<section id="versioning">
<h2 id="specificationversioningspec_versioning">Specification Versioning</h2>

<p>This specification follows the specification version guidelines given in [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>
</section>

<section id="namespaces">
<h2>Namespaces</h2>

<p> In addition to the namespace URIs and namespace prefixes <code>oslc</code>, <code>rdf</code>, <code>dcterms</code> and <code>foaf</code> defined in the [[!OSLCCore3]], OSLC RM defines the namespace URI of <code>http://open-services.net/ns/rm#</code> with a preferred namespace prefix of <code>oslc_rm</code>.</p>

</section>

<section id="formats">
<h2>Resource Formats</h2>

<p>In addition to the requirements for resource representations in [[!OSLCCore3]], this section outlines further refinements and restrictions.</p>

<p>For HTTP GET/PUT/POST requests on all OSLC RM and OSLC Core defined resource types,
</p> 

<ul>
<li> RM Servers MUST support RDF/XML representations with media-type <code>application/rdf+xml</code>. RM Clients MUST be prepared to deal with any valid RDF/XML document.
</li> <li> RM Servers MUST support XML representations with media-type <code>application/xml</code>. The XML representations MUST follow the guidelines outlined in the <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations">OSLC Core Representations Guidance</a> to maintain compatibility with [[!OSLCCore2]].
</li> <li> RM Servers MAY support JSON representations with media-type <code>application/json</code>. The JSON representations MUST follow the guidelines outlined in the <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations">OSLC Core Representations Guidance</a> to maintain compatibility with [[!OSLCCore2]].
</li></ul> 
</p>
Additionally, for HTTP GET, <ul>
<li> RM Servers SHOULD provide an [X]HTML representation and a user interface (UI) preview as defined by <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreUiPreview">UI Preview Guidance</a>
</li></ul> 
</p>
For HTTP GET response formats for Query requests, <ul>
<li> RM Servers MUST support RDF/XML representations with meda-type <code>application/rdf+xml</code>.
</li> <li> RM Servers MUST support XML representations with media-type <code>application/xml</code>.
</li> <li> RM Servers MAY support JSON representations with media-type <code>application/json</code>.
</li></ul> 
</p>
OSLC Servers MAY refuse to accept RDF/XML documents which do not have a top-level rdf:RDF document element. The OSLC Core describes an example, non-normative algorithm for generating RDF/XML representations of OSLC Defined Resources.
</p>
In addition to the resource formats defined above, Servers MAY support additional resource formats; the meaning and usage of these resource formats is not defined by this specification.
</p>

</section>
  
<section id="authentication">
<h2>Authentication</h2>

<p>[[!OSLCCore3]] specifies the recommended OSLC authentication mechanisms. In addition to the OSLC Core authentication requirements, OSLC RM servers SHOULD support [[!OpenIDConnect]].</p>
</section>

<section id="errors">
<h2>Error Responses</h2>

<p>[[!OSLCCoreVocab]] specifies the OSLC Core error responses. OSLC RM puts no additional constraints on error responses.</p>
</section>

<section id="pagination">
<h2>Pagination</h2>

<p>OSLC RM servers SHOULD support pagination of query results and MAY support pagination of a single resource's properties as defined by [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>
</section>

<section id="requestProps">
<h3>Requesting and Updating Properties</h3>

<section id="requestSubset">
<h4>Requesting a Subset of Properties</h4>

<p>A client MAY request a subset of a resource's properties as well as properties from a referenced resource. In order to support this behavior a server MUST support the <code>oslc.properties</code> and <code>oslc.prefix</code> URL parameter on a HTTP GET request on individual resource request or a collection of resources by query. If the <code>oslc.properties</code> parameter is omitted on the request, then all resource properties MUST be provided in the response.</p>
</section>

<section id="updateSubset">
<h4>Updating a Subset of Properties</h4>

<p>A client MAY request that a subset of a resource's properties be updated by using the [[LDPPatch]] <code>PATCH</code> method.</p>

<p>For compatibility with [[!OSLCCore2]], a Server MAY also support partial update by identifying those properties to be modified using the <code>oslc.properties</code> URL parameter on a HTTP PUT request.</p>

<p>If the parameter <code>oslc.properties</code> contains a valid resource property on the request that is not provided in the content, the server MUST set the resource's property to a null or empty value. If the parameter <code>oslc.properties</code> contains an invalid resource property, then a <code>409 Conflict</code> MUST be returned.</p>
</section>

<section id="updatingMultiValueProps">
<h4>Updating Multi-Valued Properties</h4>

<p>For multi-valued properties that contain a large number of values, it may be difficult and inefficient to add or remove property values. OSLC RM servers MAY provide support for a partial update of the multi-valued properties as defined by draft specification [[LDPPatch]]. RM servers MAY also support partial updates through HTTP PUT where only the updated properties are included in the entity request body.</p>
</section>
</section>

<section id="labels" class='informative'>
<h3>Labels for Relationships</h3>

<p>Requirement Management relationships to other resources are represented by RDF properties. Instances of a relationship - often called links - are RDF triples with a subject URI, a predicate that is the property, and a value (or object) that is the URI of target resource. When a link is to be presented in a user interface, it may be helpful to display an informative and useful textual label instead of, or in addition to, the URI of the predicate and/or object. There are three items that clients could display:
<ul>
  <li><b>The property</b>: OSLC recommends using the rdfs:label property of the rdf:Property from the vocabulary to display the property.</li>
  <li><b>The value, or object of the triple</b>: OSLC recommends using OSLC resource preview [[!OSLCResourcePreview]] to obtain an appropriate icon and label, and possibly a small and/or large dialog for displaying the object.</li>
  <li><b>The link</b>: The link is a combination of the subject, predicate and object of the triple (RDF statement or assertion). In the case where the link requires a unique label that is not available from the target resource, only then OSLC servers may support a dcterms:title on a reified statement to provide a label for a link that describes the assertion itself.</li>
</ul></p> 

<p>Turtle example using a reified statement:</p>

<pre class="example">
@prefix oslc_rm: &lt;http://open-services.net/ns/rm#&gt; .
@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .
@prefix dcterms: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt; .

<h2>RM Server Capabilities</h2>

<section id="resources">
<h3>Server Resources</h3>

<p>RM Servers MUST provide one or more <code>oslc:ServiceProvider</code> resources. Discovery of OSLC Service Provider Resources MAY be via one or more OSLC Service Provider Catalog Resources, or may be discovered by some other and/or additional Provider-specific means beyond the scope of this specification. The <code>oslc:Service</code> resources referenced by this <code>oslc:ServiceProvider</code> MUST have an <code>oslc:domain</code> of <code>http://open-services.net/ns/rm#</code>.
</p>

<p>RM servers MAY provide other forms of discovery described in Core 3.0 Discovery.</p>

<p>RM Servers MAY provide one more more <code>oslc:ServiceProviderCatalog</code> resources. Any such catalog resources MUST include at least one <code>oslc:domain</code> of <code>http://open-services.net/ns/rm#</code>. Discovery of top-level OSLC Service Provider Catalog Resources is beyond the scope of this specification.
</p>

<p>Service providers MUST give an <code>oslc:serviceProvider</code> property on all OSLC Defined Resources. This property MUST refer to an appropriate <code>oslc:ServiceProvider</code> resource.
</p>

</section>


<section id="creationfactories">
<h3>Creation Factories</h3>

<p>RM Servers supporting resource creation MUST do so through <code>oslc:CreationFactory</code> resources, as defined by [[!OSLCCore3]]. Any such factory resources MUST be discoverable through <code>oslc:Service</code> resources. Servers SHOULD provide <code>oslc:ResourceShape</code> resources on <code>oslc:CreationFactory</code> resources as defined by <a class="twikiAnchorLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixA#oslc_ResourceShape_Resource">OSLC Core Specification Appendix A: Common Properties - Resource Shapes</a>.</p>

</section>

<section id="querycapabilities">
<h3 id="querycapabilities">Query Capabilities</h3>

<p>RM Servers MUST support query capabilities, as defined by [[!OSLCCore3]]. Servers SHOULD provide <code>oslc:ResourceShape</code> on <code>oslc:QueryCapability</code> resources as defined by <a class="twikiAnchorLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixA#oslc_ResourceShape_Resource">OSLC Core Specification Appendix A: Common Properties - Resource Shapes</a>.
</p>

<p>The Query Capability, if supported, MUST support these parameters: <ul>
<li> <code>oslc.where</code>
</li> <li> <code>oslc.select</code>
</li> <li> <code>oslc.properties</code>
</li> <li> <code>oslc.prefix</code>
</li></ul> 
</p>

<p>Where <code>oslc:ResourceShape</code> is not supported by the Query Capability, Servers SHOULD use the following guidance to represent query results: <ul>
<li> For RDF/XML and XML, use <code>rdf:Description</code> and <code>rdfs:member</code> as defined by <a class="twikiAnchorLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations#RDF_XML_Examples">Core Specification Appendix B:Representations and Examples - RDF/XML Examples</a>.
</li> <li> For JSON the query results are contained within <code>oslc:results</code> array. See <a class="twikiAnchorLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations#Guidelines_for_JSON">Core Specification Appendix B: Representations and Examples - Guidelines for JSON</a>.
</li></ul> 
</p>
The stability of query results is OPTIONAL (see <a class="twikiLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification">Core Specification Version 2.0 - Stable Paging</a>).</p>
</section>

<section id="delegatedUIs">
<h3>Delegated UIs</h3>

<p>RM Servers MUST support the selection and creation of resources by delegated web-based user interface dialogs <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Delegated_User_Interface_Dialogs">Delegated UIs</a> as defined by [[!OSLCCore3]].
</p>

<p>RM Servers MAY support the pre-filling of creation dialogs based on the definition at <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Delegated_User_Interface_Dialogs">Delegated UIs</a>.</p>

</section>

<section id="usageidentifiers">
<h3>Usage Identifiers</h3>

<p>RM Servers MAY identify the usage of various services with additional property values for the <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Service_Provider_Resources">OSLC Core</a> defined <code>oslc:usage</code> property on <code>oslc:Dialog</code>, <code>CreationFactory</code> and <code>QueryCapability</code>. The <code>oslc:usage</code> property value of <code>http://open-services.net/ns/core#default</code> SHOULD be used to designate the default or primary service to be used by consumers when multiple entries are found.
</p>
There are no additional usage identifiers defined by this specification. RM Servers MAY provide their own usage URIs. Such usage URIs MUST be in a non-OSLC namespace.

The specification is modified to build on the [[!OSLCCore3]] Specification. 
</p>

<h3>Version Compatibility with 1.0 Specifications </h3>
<p>
The goal is to provide a smooth transition to 2.0 for both Clients and Servers. This section will clarify the usage of 1.0 media types so that Servers can support both 1.0 and 2.0 Clients when HTTP requests are made for a resource with the same URI.
</p>
<p>
Network addressable resource URIs used for 1.0 resources for these types: Requirement, RequirementCollection, ServiceDescriptor and ServiceProviderCatalog, should not have to change. Clients who support both 1.0 and 2.0, should only preserve these resource URIs. When a Server starts to serve 2.0 resource formats, for instance the ServiceProvider resource, it is recommended to update its locally stored or cached information about the contents of the ServiceProvider resource as the URIs to various capabilities may have changed (query, delegated UIs, factories, etc.).
