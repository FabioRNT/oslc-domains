  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This family of documents defines the Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration Requirements Management and Definition specification, also known as OSLC RM. These documents collectively define the OSLC RM 2.0 specification, which is part of the OSLC group of specifications. This specification supports key REST APIs for software Requirements Management systems. OSLC RM 2.0 takes an open, loosely coupled approach to specific lifecycle integration scenarios. The scenarios and this V2.0 specification were created by the OSLC RM Working Group. More information on the principles underlying OSLC and RM in particular can be found on the main OSLC site and the home page of the RM topic.
  </p>
 
  <p>This specification builds on the Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) Core v2.0 Specification to define the resources, properties and operations supported by an OSLC Requirements Definition and Management (OSLC-RM) provider.
</p>

  <p>
Requirements Management resources include Requirements, Requirements Collections and supporting resources defined in the OSLC Core specification. The properties defined describe these resources and the relationships between resources. Operations are defined in terms of HTTP methods and MIME type handling. The resources, properties and operations defined do not form a comprehensive interface to Requirements Definition and Management, but instead target specific integration use cases documented by the OSLC-RM workgroup.

      <dl class="glossary">
      <dt>Requirement Resource</dt>
      <dd>Requirements are the basis for defining what the system stakeholders (users, customers, suppliers and so on)           need from a system and also what the system must do in order to meet those needs, and how the surrounding           processes must be orchestrated so that quality, scope and timescale objectives are satisfied.</dd>

    <dt>Server</dt>
    <dd>An implementation of the OSLC Change Management specifications as a server. OSLC CM clients consume services provided by Servers. The use of the terms Client and Server are intended to distinguish typical consumers and providers of OSLC resources in a distributed environment based on REST.

<section id="versioning">
<h2 id="specificationversioningspec_versioning">Specification Versioning</h2>

<p>This specification follows the specification version guidelines given in [OSLCCore3].</p>
</section>

<section id="namespaces">
<h2>Namespaces</h2>

<p> In addition to the namespace URIs and namespace prefixes <code>oslc</code>, <code>rdf</code>, <code>dcterms</code> and <code>foaf</code> defined in the [OSLCCore3], OSLC RM defines the namespace URI of <code>http://open-services.net/ns/rm#</code> with a preferred namespace prefix of <code>oslc_rm</code>.</p>

</section>

<section id="formats">
<h2>Resource Formats</h2>

<p>In addition to the requirements for resource representations in [[!OSLCCore3]], this section outlines further refinements and restrictions.</p>

<p>For HTTP GET/PUT/POST requests on all OSLC RM and OSLC Core defined resource types,
</p> 

<ul>
<li> RM Providers <strong>MUST</strong> support RDF/XML representations with media-type <code>application/rdf+xml</code>. RM Consumers <strong>MUST</strong> be prepared to deal with any valid RDF/XML document.
</li> <li> RM Providers <strong>MUST</strong> support XML representations with media-type <code>application/xml</code>. The XML representations <strong>MUST</strong> follow the guidelines outlined in <a class="twikiLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations">Core Specification Appendix B: Representations and Examples</a>.
</li> <li> RM Providers <strong>MAY</strong> support JSON representations with media-type <code>application/json</code>. The JSON representations <strong>MUST</strong> follow the guidelines outlined in <a class="twikiLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations">Core Specification Appendix B: Representations and Examples</a>.
</li></ul> 
</p>
Additionally, for HTTP GET, <ul>
<li> RM Providers <strong>SHOULD</strong> provide an [X]HTML representation and a user interface (UI) preview as defined by <a class="twikiLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreUiPreview">Core Specification Version 2.0 UI Preview</a>
</li></ul> 
</p>
For HTTP GET response formats for Query requests, <ul>
<li> RM Providers <strong>MUST</strong> support RDF/XML representations with meda-type <code>application/rdf+xml</code>.
</li> <li> RM Providers <strong>MUST</strong> support XML representations with media-type <code>application/xml</code>.
</li> <li> RM Providers <strong>MAY</strong> support JSON representations with media-type <code>application/json</code>.
</li></ul> 
</p>
OSLC Providers <strong>MAY</strong> refuse to accept RDF/XML documents which do not have a top-level rdf:RDF document element. The OSLC Core describes an example, non-normative algorithm for generating RDF/XML representations of OSLC Defined Resources.
</p>
In addition to the resource formats defined above, providers <strong>MAY</strong> support additional resource formats; the meaning and usage of these resource formats is not defined by this specification.
</p>


</section>
  

<section id="authentication">
<h2>Authentication</h2>

<p>[[!OSLCCore3]] specifies the recommended OSLC authentication mechanisms. In addition to the OSLC Core authentication requirements, OSLC CM servers SHOULD support [[!OpenIDConnect]].</p>
</section>

<section id="errors">
<h2>Error Responses</h2>

<p>[[!OSLCCoreVocab]] specifies the OSLC Core error responses. OSLC CM puts no additional constraints on error responses.</p>
</section>

<section id="pagination">
<h2>Pagination</h2>

<p>OSLC RM servers SHOULD support pagination of query results and MAY support pagination of a single resource's properties as defined by [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>
</section>

<section id="requestProps">
<h3>Requesting and Updating Properties</h3>

<section id="requestSubset">
<h4>Requesting Selected Properties</h4>

<p>A client may want to request a subset of a resource's properties as well as properties from a referenced resource. In order to support this behaviour a service provider <strong>MUST</strong> support the <code>oslc.properties</code> and <code>oslc.prefix</code> URL parameter on a HTTP GET request on individual resource request or a collection of resources by query. If the <code>oslc.properties</code> parameter is omitted on the request, or if the value of this parameter is "*", then all resource properties <strong>MUST</strong> be provided in the response. See <a class="twikiAnchorLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Selective_Property_Values">OSLC Core Specification - Selective Property Values</a>.
</section>

<section id="updateSubset">
<h4>Updating Selected Properties</h4>

<p>A provide <strong>MAY</strong> accept <code>oslc.properties</code> on a PUT with the meaning that only that subset of the resource's properties be updated.
</p>
If the parameter <code>oslc.properties</code> contains a valid resource property on the request that is not provided in the content, the server <strong>MUST</strong> treat that as a request to remove that property from the resource. If the parameter <code>oslc.properties</code> contains an invalid resource property, then a <code>409 Conflict</code> <strong>MUST</strong> be returned.
</p>

</section>
</section>

<section id="labels" class='informative'>
<h3>Labels for Relationships</h3>

 When an RM relationship property is to be presented in a user interface, it may be helpful to provide an informative and useful textual label for that relationship instance. (This in addition to the relationship property URI and the object resource URI, which are also candidates for presentation to a user.) To this end, OSLC providers <strong>MAY</strong> suppport a dcterms:title link property in RM resource representations where a relationship property is permitted, using the anchor approach outlined in the OSLC Core Links Guidance.
</p>
Providers and consumers should be aware that the dcterms:title of a link is unrelated to the dcterms:title of the object resource. Indeed, links may carry other properties with names in common to the object of the link, but there is no specified relationship between these property values.

</section>


<section id="capabilities">
<h2>RM Server Capabilities</h2>

<section id="resources">
<h3>Server Resources</h3>

<p>Service providers <strong>MUST</strong> provide one or more <code>oslc:ServiceProvider</code> resources as defined by <a class="twikiAnchorLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Service_Provider_Resources">Core Specification Version 2.0 - Service Provider Resource</a>. Discovery of OSLC Service Provider Resources <strong>MAY</strong> be via one or more OSLC Service Provider Catalog Resources, or may be discovered by some other and/or additional Provider-specific means outwith the scope of this specification. The <code>oslc:Service</code> resources referenced by this <code>oslc:ServiceProvider</code> <strong>MUST</strong> have an <code>oslc:domain</code> of <code>http://open-services.net/ns/rm#</code>.
</p>
Service providers <strong>MAY</strong> provide one more more <code>oslc:ServiceProviderCatalog</code> resources as defined by <a class="twikiAnchorLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Service_Provider_Catalog_Resources">Core Specification Version 2.0 - Service Provider Resources</a>. Any such catalog resources <strong>MUST</strong> include at least one <code>oslc:domain</code> of <code>http://open-services.net/ns/rm#</code>. Discovery of top-level OSLC Service Provider Catalog Resources is outwith the scope of this specification.
</p>
Service providers <strong>MUST</strong> give an <code>oslc:serviceProvider</code> property on all OSLC Defined Resources. This property <strong>MUST</strong> refer to an appropriate <code>oslc:ServiceProvider</code> resource.
</p>

</section>


<section id="creationfactories">
<h3>Creation Factories</h3>

<p>Service providers supporting resource creation <strong>MUST</strong> do so through <code>oslc:CreationFactory</code> resources, as defined by <a class="twikiAnchorLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Creation_Factories">Core Specification Version 2.0 - Creation Factories</a>. Any such factory resources <strong>MUST</strong> be discoverable through <code>oslc:Service</code> resources. Providers <strong>SHOULD</strong> provide <code>oslc:ResourceShape</code> resources on <code>oslc:CreationFactory</code> resources as defined by <a class="twikiAnchorLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixA#oslc_ResourceShape_Resource">OSLC Core Specification Appendix A: Common Properties - Resource Shapes</a>.</p>

</section>

<section id="querycapabilities">
<h3 id="querycapabilities">Query Capabilities</h3>

<p>Service providers <strong>MUST</strong> support query capabilities, as defined by <a class="twikiAnchorLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Query_Capabilities">Core Specification Version 2.0 - Query Capabilities</a>. Providers <strong>SHOULD</strong> provide <code>oslc:ResourceShape</code> on <code>oslc:QueryCapability</code> resources as defined by <a class="twikiAnchorLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixA#oslc_ResourceShape_Resource">OSLC Core Specification Appendix A: Common Properties - Resource Shapes</a>.
</p>
The Query Capability <strong>MUST</strong> support these parameters: <ul>
<li> <code>oslc.where</code>
</li> <li> <code>oslc.select</code>
</li> <li> <code>oslc.properties</code>
</li> <li> <code>oslc.prefix</code>
</li></ul> 
</p>
Where <code>oslc:ResourceShape</code> is not supported by the Query Capability, providers <strong>SHOULD</strong> use the following guidance to represent query results: <ul>
<li> For RDF/XML and XML, use <code>rdf:Description</code> and <code>rdfs:member</code> as defined by <a class="twikiAnchorLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations#RDF_XML_Examples">Core Specification Appendix B:Representations and Examples - RDF/XML Examples</a>.
</li> <li> For JSON the query results are contained within <code>oslc:resutls</code> array. See <a class="twikiAnchorLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations#Guidelines_for_JSON">Core Specification Appendix B: Representations and Examples - Guidelines for JSON</a>.
</li></ul> 
</p>
The stability of query results is OPTIONAL (see <a class="twikiLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification">Core Specification Version 2.0 - Stable Paging</a>).</p>
</section>

<section id="delegatedUIs">
<h3>Delegated UIs</h3>

<p>OSLC RM service providers <strong>MUST</strong> support the selection and creation of resources by delegated web-based user interface dialogs <a class="twikiAnchorLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Delegated_User_Interface_Dialogs">Delegated UIs</a> as defined by OSLC Core.
</p>
OSLC RM service providers <strong>MAY</strong> support the pre-filling of creation dialogs based on the definition at <a class="twikiAnchorLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Delegated_User_Interface_Dialogs">Delegated UIs</a>.</p>

</section>

<section id="usageidentifiers">
<h3>Usage Identifiers</h3>

<p>OSLC RM service provider <strong>MAY</strong> identify the usage of various services with additional property values for the <a class="twikiAnchorLink" href="/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Service_Provider_Resources">OSLC Core</a> defined <code>oslc:usage</code> property on <code>oslc:Dialog</code>, <code>CreationFactory</code> and <code>QueryCapability</code>. The <code>oslc:usage</code> property value of <code>http://open-services.net/ns/core#default</code> <strong>SHOULD</strong> be used to designate the default or primary service to be used by consumers when multiple entries are found.
</p>
There are no additional usage identifiers defined by this specification. OSLC Providers <strong>MAY</strong> provide their own usage URIs. Such usage URIs <strong>MUST</strong> be in a non-OSLC namespace.
