<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This specification defines a vocabulary and resource shapes for common
    requirements-management resources. The intent is to define resources needed to
    support common integration scenarios and not to provide a comprehensive
    definition of a Change Request. The resource formats may not match exactly
    the native models supported by change management service providers, but are
    intended to be compatible with them. The approach to supporting these
    scenarios is to delegate operations, as driven by service provider
    contributed user interfaces, as much as possible and not require a service
    provider to expose its complete data model and application logic.</p>

<section id="terminology">
<h1>Terminology</h1>
<p>Terminology is based on OSLC Core Overview [[!OSLCCore3]], W3C Linked Data
    Platform [[!LDP]], W3C's Architecture of the World Wide Web [[WEBARCH]],
    Hyper-text Transfer Protocol [[!HTTP11]].</p>

<section id="conventions">
<p>In addition to the namespace URIs and namespace prefixes <code>oslc</code>, <code>rdf</code>, <code>dcterms</code> and <code>foaf</code> defined in the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/oslc-core/oslc-core/v3.0/oslc-core-v3.0-part1-overview.html">OSLC Core specification</a>, OSLC rm defines the namespace URI of <code>http://open-services.net/ns/rm#</code> with a namespace prefix of <code>oslc_rm</code></p>

<p>This specification also uses these namespace prefix definitions:</p>

<ul>
<li>oslc_rm : <code>http://open-services.net/ns/rm#</code> [[OSLCRM]]</li>
<li>oslc_qm : <code>http://open-services.net/ns/qm#</code> [[OSLCQM]]</li>

<h2>requirements-management Resource Constraints</h2>
<p />
The meaning of Requirement resource properties are defined in the tables below, together with their multiplicity constraints. Requirement resource properties are not limited to the ones defined in this specification, service providers may provide additional properties. It is strongly recommended that any additional properties be defined in XML namespaces distinct from those defined by OSLC in these specifications. Requirement creation through a Creation Factory resource in the Service Description is <strong>REQUIRED</strong> by this specification.
<p />
Any <strong>resource</strong> asserted to be of <code>rdf:type</code> <code>http://open-services.net/ns/rm#Requirement</code> <strong>MUST</strong> conform to the constraints and meaning of properties defined below. Notice that partial representations of a requirement resource are admitted by this specification (for example, in query results, or where <code>oslc.properties</code> has been used), and such partial representations will in general not conform to these constraints.
