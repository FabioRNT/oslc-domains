<section id='abstract'>
<p>This specification defines the OSLC Quality Management domain, a RESTful web
services interface for the management of product, service or software quality artefacts, activities,
tasks and relationships between those and related resources such as requirements, defects, change requests or architectural resources. To support these scenarios, this specification
defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET,
POST, PUT and DELETE, HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource
formats.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This specification builds on the OSLC Core Specification [[!OSLCCore3]] to define the resources and operations supported by an Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) Quality Management (QM) provider.</p>
  <p>Quality Management resources define the test plans, test cases, and test results of the software delivery lifecycle. They represent individual resources along with their relationships to other shared resource types such change requests and requirements. The intent of this specification is to define the set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, HTTP response codes, mime type handling and resource formats. The capabilities of the interface definitions are driven by key integration scenarios and therefore don't represent a complete setup of operations on resources or resource types. The resource formats and operations may not match exactly the native models supported by quality management service providers but are intended to be compatible with them. </p>
  <p>A key approach to supporting these scenarios is to delegate operations, as driven by service provider contributed user interfaces, as much as possible and not require a service provider to expose its complete data model and application logic. </p>

<section id="baseConformance">
<h2>Base Conformance</h2>

<p class='conformance'>This specification is based on [[!OSLCCore3]]. OSLC QM servers
MUST be compliant with both the core specification,  MUST follow all the mandatory requirements in the normative sections of this specification, and SHOULD follow all the guidelines and recommendations in both
these specifications.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes the requirements from OSLC Core Specification [[!OSLCCore3]]
as well as some additional requirements specific to the QM domain. Note that
this specification further restricts some of the requirements for OSLC Core
Specification. See subsequent sections in this specification or the
OSLC Core Specification [[!OSLCCore3]] to get further details on each of these
requirements.</p>

<p>This specification follows the specification version guidelines given in [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>
</section>

<section id="namespaces">
<h2>Namespaces</h2>

<p>In addition to the namespace URIs and namespace prefixes <code>oslc</code>, <code>rdf</code>, <code>dcterms</code> and <code>foaf</code> defined in the [[!OSLCCore3]], OSLC QM defines the namespace URI of <code>http://open-services.net/ns/qm#</code> with a namespace prefix of <code>oslc_qm</code>.</p>

<p>This specification also uses these namespace prefix definitions:</p>

<ul>
<li>oslc_cm : <code>http://open-services.net/ns/cm#</code> [[OSLCCM]]</li>
<li>oslc_rm : <code>http://open-services.net/ns/rm#</code> [[OSLCRM]]</li>
</ul>

<p>For HTTP GET requests on all OSLC QM and OSLC Core defined resource types,</p>

<ul>
<li class='conformance'>QM servers MAY provide Turtle and JSON-LD, and MUST provide RDF/XML and XML representations.

<li class='conformance'>QM servers SHOULD support an [X]HTML representation and a user interface (UI) preview as defined by <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreUiPreview">UI Preview Guidance</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For HTTP PUT/POST request formats for QM resource of type TestPlan, TestCase, TestScript, TestExecutionRecord and TestResult  :</p>

<ul>
<li class='conformance'>QM servers MUST accept Turtle and JSON-LD representations and SHOULD accept RDF/XML and XML representations. QM servers accepting RDF/XML SHOULD be prepared for any valid RDF/XML document. For XML, QM servers SHOULD be prepared for representations that follow the guidelines outlined in the <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations">OSLC Core Representations Guidance</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For HTTP GET response formats for Query requests,</p>

<p class='conformance'>QM servers MUST provide Turtle and JSON-LD, SHOULD provide RDF/XML, XML, and MUST provide Atom Syndication Format XML representations.</p>

<p>When QM clients request:</p>

<ul>
<li class='conformance'><code>text/turtle</code> QM servers MUST respond with Turtle representation.</li>
<li class='conformance'><code>application/ld+json</code> QM servers MUST respond with JSON-LD representation.</li>

<section id="labels" class='informative'>
<h3>Labels for Relationships</h3>

<p>QM resource relationships to other resources are represented by RDF properties. Instances of a relationship - often called links - are RDF triples with a subject URI, a predicate that is the property, and a value (or object) that is the URI of target resource. When a link is to be presented in a user interface, it may be helpful to display an informative and useful textual label instead of or in addition to the URI of the predicate and or object. There are three items that clients could display:
<ul>
  <li><b>The property</b>: OSLC recommends using the rdfs:label property of the rdf:Property from the vocabulary to display the property.</li>
  <li><b>The value, or object of the triple</b>: OSLC recommends using OSLC resource preview [[!OSLCResourcePreview]] to obtain an appropriate icon and label, and possibly a small and/or large dialog for displaying the object.</li>
  <li><b>The link</b>: The link is a combination of the subject, predicate and object of the triple (RDF statement or assertion). In the case where the link requires a unique label that is not available from the target resource, only then OSLC servers may support a dcterms:title on a reified statement to provide a label for a link that describes the assertion itself.</li>
</ul></p> 

<p>Turtle example using a reified statement:</p>

<pre class="example">
@prefix oslc_qm: &lt;http://open-services.net/ns/qm#&gt; .
@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .
@prefix dcterms: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt; .

&lt;http://example.com/testcase/4321&gt;
  a &lt;http://open-services.net/ns/qm#TestCase&gt; ;
  oslc_qm:usesTestScript &lt;http://anotherexample.com/testscript/123&gt; .

&lt;http://njh.me/#link1&gt;
  a rdf:Statement ;

  rdf:predicate ns0:uses ;
  rdf:object &lt;http://example.com/testscript/123&gt; ;

<h2>Version Compatibility with 1.0 Specifications</h2>
<h3>Media Types</h3>
<p>For a resource format identification of RDF/XML and XML, the media type used for this representation SHOULD be application/rdf+xml or application/xml. The usage of the OSLC QM 1.0 defined media types of application/x-oslc-qm-* is being deprecated.</p>
<h3>Requesting formats</h3>
<p>QM 1.0 consumers wanting to request 1.0 resource formats will not need to change if they used 1.0 defined media types ( application/x-oslc-qm*), see OSLC-QM 1.0. QM 2.0 consumers should use media types as defined in this specification for requests, excluding the OSLC QM 1.0 specific media types ( application/x-oslc-qm*). QM consumers supporting both 1.0 and 2.0, may request request both 1.0 and 2.0 media types on HTTP GET requests as usually done with HTTP request parameter Accept giving appropriate quality (See HTTP Accept) weighting to help distinguish their preferred content. </p>
<p>For additional guidance, a QM 2.0 consumer or provider MAY reference the OSLC-Core-Version HTTP header with a value of 2.0. </p>

<h2>Changes from Version 2.0</h2>
<p>There are no substantive changes from OSLC QM Specification 2.0. This document is a document maintenance update of the version 2.0 document to support migration from open-services.net to OASIS.The changes are all upward compatible additions and therefore do not introduce incompatibilities with version 2.0.</p>
<p>Specific ommissions for Turtle and JSO were included in Section 2.1 and 2.4.</p>
